Consider the network in the gure, where each node represents a terminal/router, and each
edge represents a bidirectional link. For each link, the bandwidth in Mbps is indicated.
1. Given a linear programming formulation for the problem of nding the maximum quantity
of data that can be sent, per second, from node c to node f.
2. Give a formulation for the multi-commodity version of the problem where we are to
maximize the sum of the 
ow between the pairs of nodes fb; dg, fd; eg, and fe; bg.
