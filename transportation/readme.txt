A company has to ship empty containers stocked in the depots of Verona, Perugia, Roma,
Pescara, Taranto, and Lamezia, to the main national harbors of Genova, Venezia, Ancona,
Napoli, and Bari.
The number of empty containers available in each depot, and the demand of containers in
each harbor, are
Availability
Verona 10
Perugia 12
Roma 20
Pescara 24
Taranto 18
Lamezia 40
Demand
Genova 20
Venezia 15
Ancona 25
Napoli 33
Bari 21
The transportation cost is of 1 Euro per km. The distances from the depots to the harbors,
in km, are the following ones
Genova Venezia Ancona Napoli Bari
Verona 290 115 355 715 810
Perugia 380 340 165 380 610
Roma 505 530 285 220 450
Pescara 655 450 155 240 315
Taranto 1010 840 550 305 95
Lamezia 1072 1097 747 372 333
1. Give a linear programming formulation for the problem of minimizing the total transporta-
tion cost.
2. Comment on the integrality constraints on the variables: are they necessary?
Sensitivity analysis
1. Are there harbors where more containers than requested are delivered?
2. Assume that the transportation cost for a depot-harbor pair which is not used in the
solution can be modied with a tax or a discount. What is the maximum variation such
that the basis of the current solution remains optimal? Does the solution change?
3. What is the greatest variation in the availability of containers in Perugia such that the
obtained basis remains optimal? How much would the solution value chage if availability
was increased by 2?
4. What is the greatest variation in containers availability in Lamezia such that
