A company has to plan the production of 3 types of fabric, A1, A2, A3, for a time horizon
of a single month with 22 work days. Sales forecasts indicate a demand, per square meter of
fabric, of 4300, 4500, and 5225 units for, respectively, A1, A2, and A3.
The following table indicates the price of each product (Euro) and its production cost per
meter (Euro/m2). It also reports the maximum number of square meters that can be produced
in a single day (pieces/day), if the whole production capability of the factory is used to produce
only that type of fabric.
Product A1 A2 A3
Price 120 100 115
Production cost 74 53 66
Production amount 500 450 550
1. Give a linear programming formulation for the problem of determining a production plan
that maximizes the total revenue.
2. Which is the maximum price that the company would pay to have one extra production
day per month?
3. Which is the decrease in profit due to a decrease in the demand of product A1 of 10 square
meters?
4. Which is the maximum amount of money that the company would invest in advertising,
so as to increase the demand of A3 by 100 square meters?
5. Which is the maximum decrease in the demand of A2 such that the optimal solution does
not change?
A company has to plan the production of 3 products, A1, A2, A3, for a time horizon of four
months, from January to April. The work days are: 22 for January, 20 for February, 23 for
March, 22 for April.
Sales forecasts indicate the following maximum demand, per product and month.
Demand January February March April
A1 5300 1200 7400 5300
A2 4500 5400 6500 7200
A3 4400 6700 12500 13200
The following table reports the price of each product (Euro) and its unit production cost (Euro).
It also reports the maximum number of pieces that can be produced in a single day (pieces/day),
if the whole production capability of the factory is used to produce units of that product.
Product A1 A2 A3
Price 124 109 115
Production cost 75 53 65
Production amount 500 450 550
Inventory can be used to store units of unsold product. The inventory cost per month and unit
is 3 for product A1, 4 for product A2, and 2 for product A3. Each month, no more than 800
total units of the three products can be stored.
1. Give an integer linear programming formulation for the problem of determining a produc-
tion plan that maximizes the total revenue.
2. Integrality restrictions are mandatory for this problem, since we are dealing with discrete
products. In spite of this, when dealing with problems involving large quantities of product,
it is often possible, when dropping the integrality constraints, to obtain solutions that are
almost integer. Assess, computationally, the dierence between integer and continuous
optimal solutions for the original formulation.
Optional questions
1. Give a formulation for the variant where a minimum lot size is required whenever a pro-
duct, per month, is produced, and where a xed cost is charged, per month and product,
whenever the production line for the corresponding product is active. Use the data:
Product A1 A2 A3
Fixed cost 150000 150000 100000
Minimum lot size 20 20 16
Note that the decision of activating the production line of a specic product is to be taken
each month.
2. Assess the eect of integrality for the variant of the problem. Do you expect the dierence
between the integer and continuous solutions to be larger in this case?
