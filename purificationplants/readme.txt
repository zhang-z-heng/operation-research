We are to choose the building site for a set of water purication plants, among 12 areas
A1; : : : ;A12, which are close to 5 cities C1; : : : ;C5. Each area can serve simultaneously all the
cities indicated with the symbol \*". The second last line reports the purication capacity, in
tons/year, of each facility (which depends on the site where the facility is built). The last line
reports the building cost, in MEuro

For each city, at least one close-by purication plant must be built.
1. Give an integer linear programming formulation for the problem of minimizing the total
building cost.
2. Give an integer linear programming formulation for the variant where each city can have
only one purication plant nearby.
3. Give an integer linear programming formulation for the variant where the total quantity
of puried water must be nonsmaller than 120  109 kg/year
